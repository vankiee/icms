# Intelligent Course Management System (ICMS)

Final group project where we developed facial login component of an ICMS GUI using Python and SQL. It contains the following functions:

- When a student logs in with their face, their information (name, login time) will be presented within a welcome message in the GUI.
- If the student has class within one hour, the corresponding course information, classroom address, teacher's message, Zoom link, class notes, and other relevant course materials will be presented in the GUI. There is also an option to send these materials to the student's email.
- If the student does not have class, the GUI will present an overview of classes taken and a personal weekly timetable.
- The system records the login time and duration stayed in the system in SQL.
